Version 1.4.0
-------------

* Trying to make rpc calls to non-existent services (no queues bound to the rpc

    calls to existing, but not-running services will not raise, but wait for
    service to come online, as before.)


Version 1.3.5
-------------

* Increased test resilience. Force-closing existing connections on rabbit
  reset


Version 1.3.4
-------------

* Use MagicMock for injection replacement in test utilities
* Use autospec=True wherever possible when mocking
* Merge ServiceContainers into a single class


Version 1.3.3
-------------

* Bugfixes enabling reconnection to the broker if the connection is temporarily
  lost.


Version 1.3.2
-------------

* Dropping headers with a `None` value because they can't be serialised by amqp


Version 1.3.1
-------------

* Add `event_handler_cls` kwarg to the `event_handler` entrypoint, for using
  a custom subclass of the EventHandler provider


Version 1.3.0
-------------

* Standalone RPC proxy interface changed to class with contextmanager interface
